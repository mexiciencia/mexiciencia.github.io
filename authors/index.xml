      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on the study of mineralogy and crystallography at the micro and nanoscale. Applying to economic geology, especially in the field of ore deposits and hydrothermal systems. Particularly, studying bearing minerals of Critical Raw Materials (PGM, Au, REE, etc.) by means of applying several electron microscopy techniques like Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Focus Ion Beam (FIB), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Precession Electron Diffraction (PED). This research consisted in the implementation of a new methodology to characterize mineral phases down to the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my career as an assistant professor, lecturing on several classes, mostly metallogeny, field geology and mineralogy at the UNAM. In 2017, I obtained my PhD at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and the title of Gemologist from the University of Barcelona while teaching as an assistant professor. My PhD thesis was a metallogenetic model of an Andean tin-indium deposit, based on its mineralogy, geochemistry and isotopic characterization. In addition, I also conducted several collaborative research projects as principal and co-principal investigator, and supervised bachelor and master students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I am a collaborator in the Horizon 2020 GEMex: Cooperation in Geothermal energy research Europe-Mexico for development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems and Superhot Geothermal Systems. Since 2017, I am co-editor of the Springer’s Geology series, and member of the NGO “Mineria para el desarrollo” (Mining for development)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somos un grupo de jóvenes Científicas y Científicos Mexican@s en el Extranjero que colaboramos con diversas instituciones de investigación en México. Estamos comprometidos con la sociedad y nuestra motivación es estrechar la brecha que existe entre el conocimiento científico especializado y el saber popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemos visto con preocupación cómo las redes sociales han sido una vía para la propagación de noticias falsas (fake news) y rumores que solo infunden incertidumbre y confusión. Queremos revertir este fenómeno y convertir estos medios en el conducto para acercarnos a la sociedad y que encuentres una alternativa confiable para informarte. También queremos poner a tu alcance nuestro trabajo científico.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a chemist with a vivid curiosity about biological phenomena and their interface with chemistry and physics. During my bachelor I was interested on the physical chemical basis of the protein crystallization phenomenon and studied the influence of electric fields to enhance molecular packing and crystal quality. On an early stage of my PhD I was focused on the rational design of chimerical variants of TIM barrel enzymes with enhanced stability. At a later stage, I highlighted the importance of protein flexibility on the susceptibility of proteins to aggregate and I described a new quantitative parameter of proteins called thermal flexibility. This concept proposes that proteins with a higher stability have a wider conformational space available when thermal energy is provided, which means that energy can be stored in many more microstates than a protein with a lower stability. This fact confers the protein with a large resilience to thermal changes. I developed this concept during my PhD to explain the differences in stability of TIM proteins, but since its publication in a Q1 journal, thermal flexibility has been cited for other research groups as a possible cause of the thermostability of different kind of proteins, such as phytases, k-like proteases, serum amyloid A and globins. I obtained my degrees with honors from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and obtained grants from the Mexican Government during all stages of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my PhD, I assumed a job as a project manager to conduct outreach activities (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redproteinas.com&#34;&gt;www.redproteinas.com&lt;/a&gt;) while continuing doing research as a collaborator of research groups in Mexico and USA. In November 2018 I was granted by the Mexican Government to join an interdisciplinary team at the Cell Structure and Dynamics at the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Here I am aligning my expertise on protein interactions and stability with my aims to contribute to cellular models of protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. I have co-authored two peer-reviewed papers and published a book chapter and two research papers as a first author, one of them also as a co-corresponding author. My research is focused on finding key molecular interactions governing protein aggregation and disease using an interdisciplinary approach from computational simulations to molecular biology and live cell imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh working on the project Numerical and analytical study of undular bores governed by the full water wave equations and bi-directional Whitham-Boussinesq equations in collaboration with Prof. Noel Smyth and Prof. Timothy Marchant. My main research interests are nonlinear dispersive equations, with a focus on water waves. Before joining University Edinburgh, I was a Craig Huneke postdoctoral fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, attending the research program Hamiltonian systems, from topology to applications through analysis program during the Fall 2018 semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I obtained my Ph.D. from the Mathematics and Mechanics Department at the Applied Mathematics Institute (IIMAS) at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, in 2017, working on non-local shallow water wave models over variable topography under the supervision of Dr.Panayotis Panayotaros In my doctoral dissertation, I proposed a Hamiltonian non-local shallow water wave model for flow over variable topography using the Hamiltonian formulation of the free surface potential flow introduced by Zakharov-Craig-Sulem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a &lt;a href=&#34;http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/aj504&#34;&gt;Research Fellow in Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; at the Department of Computer Science, Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Exeter, United Kingdom (UK). Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alliancembs.manchester.ac.uk/research/decision-science/&#34;&gt;Decision and Cognitive Sciences Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;, University of Manchester, UK. I hold M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cinvestav.mx/&#34;&gt;Cinvestav-IPN&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main research interests involve the study and design of data clustering techniques based on nature-inspired metaheuristics and their applications to different research fields such as machine learning and bioinformatics. Recently, I have been focused on the development of a multi-objective evolutionary approach for multi-view data clustering and its application to a range of domains, ranging from network analysis to medical imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doctor in Astrophysics with 7 years of expertise in research. Mostly on the development of numerical/computational tools for physical and astrophysical simulations. I have a high expertise in programming, data analysis and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am creative, innovative, analyst and hard worker. During my PhD studies I developed high programming skills in several languages such as Python, R, Fortran, C++, Shell, etc., and version control tools like Git using platforms such as GitHub and Bitbucket. I worked on developing sophisticated numerical tools which were implemented to simulate blazars flares (prompt high energy radiation from relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei). This has shown my fast learning skill of new programming languages and develop efficient codes to solve the problem posed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am coauthor of three articles in peer reviewed scientific journals and author of a doctoral thesis, qualified as innovative, in which several numerical and programming issues were overcome, reason why it received the distinction of excellent. In addition, I have good English skills which makes me capable of discussing and interact fluently in both Spanish and English.&lt;/p&gt;
