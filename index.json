During my bachelor I was interested on the physical chemical basis of the protein crystallization phenomenon and studied the influence of electric fields to enhance molecular packing and crystal quality. On an early stage of my PhD I was focused on the rational design of chimerical variants of TIM barrel enzymes with enhanced stability. At a later stage, I highlighted the importance of protein flexibility on the susceptibility of proteins to aggregate and I described a new quantitative parameter of proteins called thermal flexibility. This concept proposes that proteins with a higher stability have a wider conformational space available when thermal energy is provided, which means that energy can be stored in many more microstates than a protein with a lower stability. This fact confers the protein with a large resilience to thermal changes. I developed this concept during my PhD to explain the differences in stability of TIM proteins, but since its publication in a Q1 journal, thermal flexibility has been cited for other research groups as a possible cause of the thermostability of different kind of proteins, such as phytases, k-like proteases, serum amyloid A and globins.

Esto puede significar la siguiente gran revolución en la biología ¿Porqué?\n        [Foto: Paul Emsley/MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]    La biología estructural se dedica a estudiar la distribución de los átomos dentro de las moléculas que participan en los procesos biológicos, así como los cambios conformacionales que sufren cuando interaccionan con otras moléculas o con diferentes copias de ellas mismas. Esto es fundamental para entender cómo funcionan las células. El primer gran hito de la biología estructural sucedió en 1951 cuando Linus Pauling publicó un modelo teórico de la hélice alfa de las proteínas, soportado en mucha imaginación y algunos datos empíricos (él mismo narró que la estructura vino a su mente mientras hacía papiroflexia). La hélice alfa es uno de los motivos de estructura secundaria más común en las proteínas y en ella los aminoácidos de la cadena polipeptídica se acomodan en forma de una “espiral escalonada” soportada por los puentes de hidrógeno formados entre un grupo carbonilo y un grupo amino del esqueleto polipeptídico.\n [Imagen hélice alfa 3Dciencia.com]\n Inspirados en el trabajo de Pauling sobre hélices, Watson y Crick utilizaron el trabajo de Rosalind Franklin para proponer el modelo de la doble hélice del ADN. El descubrimiento de esta estructura 🧬 revolucionó la Biología 🌿 e hizo posible entender cómo se transmiten los genes de una célula a otra.\n        [Rosalind Franklin bb y su fotografía del DNA. Este año celebramos 100 años del nacimiento de esta extraordinaria científica]    Poco tiempo después (1959) vino otra gran revolución en la Biología: se obtuvo por primera vez la estructura terciaria de una proteína. Las proteínas realizan casi todos los procesos biológicos y conocerlas a detalle ha significado comprender a detalle la vida (al menos en el sentido de los mecanismos moleculares que la hacen posible).\n [Modelo de Max Perutz de la hemoglobina]\n Obtener las “fotos” de la hemoglobina no fue tan fácil. Estas fotos se las debemos a una técnica llamada difracción de rayos X. ¡Con ella hemos observado componentes del átomo! Pero esta técnica tiene un problema: se necesita obtener un cristal de la macromolécula para obtener un patrón de difracción que nos revele información de la estructura. ¿Y qué es un cristal? Un cristal es un arreglo molecular con un patrón que se replica en las tres dimensiones. Por ejemplo, en la sal común, los iones de cloro y de sodio están distribuidos de forma ordenada y regular como las losas en un mosaico tridimensional.\n [© Thinkstock]\n Un cristal de proteína debe conseguir el mismo ordenamiento pero con moléculas que son tres órdenes de magnitud más grandes que la sal, que tienen una forma mucho más irregular y cuyos enlaces poseen vibraciones y rotaciones que confieren a la molécula de mucha más movilidad. Encontrar las condiciones para obtenerlo puede tomar meses e incluso años.\n [Foto: ScienceDirect]\n Las “fotos” obtenida por la difracción de rayos X es la interpretación que hacemos del patrón de luz y sombras generado cuando los rayos X pasan a través del cristal. Esta técnica se ha usado para obtener el 89% de las estructuras que conocemos hasta ahora y depositadas en el Banco de Proteínas (Protein Data Bank). La otra técnica más utilizada hasta ahora para obtener estructuras de proteínas es la Resonancia Magnética Nuclear, pero esa es otra historia y será contada en otra ocasión.  [Protein Data Bank]\n Pero en 1997 se resolvió por primera vez la estructura de una proteína por una técnica nueva: Criomicroscopía Electrónica (Cryo-EM). En esta técnica no hace falta tener un cristal de proteína. La muestra se congela con nitrógeno líquido y se bombardea con electrones. Después se registra el choque de cada electrón en un sensor al rebotar en la muestra. Así como los murciélagos usan ondas de sonido para conocer el mundo, los electrones permiten reconstruir una imagen 2D de una molécula. Tomar varias “fotos” de la molécula en diferentes posiciones permite construir una imagen 3D.\n [Imagen ©Askabiologist]  La mayor limitación de Cryo-EM era la resolución de la imagen formada, es decir, la capacidad de obtener la señal que proviene de la molécula y reducir la de los alrededores. Y también descartar la información de la molécula cuando es dañada por los electrones. La calidad de la foto de Cryo-EM depende de la información que podamos deducir de la trayectoria de cada electrón a partir de su choque contra el detector. Por eso es importante controlar hacia donde apuntamos los electrones y estar seguros que los choques que detectamos no dañaron la molécula. La dirección hacia la que la lente del microscopio redirige los electrones depende de la velocidad a la que los disparamos. Si lanzamos los electrones a la misma velocidad tendremos mayor seguridad de que son lanzados a la misma dirección que si los lanzamos con diferentes velocidades. Un ajuste importante para poder ver los átomos con Cryo-EM fue controlar con mayor exactitud la velocidad de los electrones pasando por la lente. Por otro lado, cuando un electrón daña una molécula cambia su velocidad, así que otro avance que nos ha permitido ver átomos, es evitar que los electrones con velocidad diferente a la original lleguen al detector. [Foto:http://myscope.com]\nAl conseguir observar átomos con Cryo-EM, se abren muchas posibilidades para estudiar moléculas dentro de la célula. Esta técnica nos ayudará a conocer con detalles el funcionamiento de las proteínas en un contexto celular: su interacción in situ con otras moléculas que le permiten llevar a cabo su función biológica, la organización supramolecular de la maquinaria celular y especialmente, los mecanismos que provocan estados patológicos, lo que llevará la medicina molecular diseñar.  \nPor ejemplo, la obtención por difracción de rayos X y por Cryo-EM de diferentes coformaciones de la estructura de la proteína que usa el SARS-CoV-2 para infectar las células, la Spike protein, está permitiendo la búsqueda racional de fármacos para combatir la enfermedad COVID-19. Ahora que se ha roto llegado a resolución atómica con Cryo-EM podremos obtener por ejemplo fotos atomísticas del virus completo infectando la célula.\n [Foto: ©Science]\n Referencias:\n https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.106740 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.106740v1 https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01658-1  ","date":1594252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594252800,"objectID":"dd109401c49f9a6a1c6582811e442cd2","permalink":"/post/cryo-em/","publishdate":"2020-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cryo-em/","section":"post","summary":"Observando átomos con Criomicroscopía electrónica","tags":["infografía"],"title":"Observando átomos con Criomicroscopía electrónica","type":"post"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero"],"categories":[],"content":"Para la contención de la propagación de la enfermedad COVID-19, ocasionada por el virus SARS-CoV-2, hasta el momento no existe ningún tratamiento cuya efectividad esté demostrada ni se cuenta con una vacuna que prevenga su diseminación. Por tal motivo, los gobiernos de todo el mundo deben tomar decisiones difíciles, cuyas consecuencias impactan la forma de vida de las personas. Ellos deben equilibrar entre el riesgo a la salud y el daño a la economía.\nLo que nos permitirá regresar a la forma de vida lo más cercana posible a como la conocíamos antes de esta pandemia será lograr que un alto porcentaje de la población genere inmunidad contra el virus. Esto se puede lograr por dos vías:\n Dejar que la enfermedad se propague libremente hasta que eventualmente un 80% de la población que sobreviva la haya padecido y superado. Inducir inmunidad a ese porcentaje de la población por medio de una vacuna.  Dado que los efectos de la enfermedad en la población de riesgo son devastadores, la vía de la inmunidad por medio de vacunas es la más ética. En ese sentido, es crucial evitar las reacciones secundarias para la población, con lo cual se garantice que los efectos negativos sean menores que la exposición al virus. Por lo mismo, desarrollar vacunas es un proceso laborioso, complejo y tardado.\nEl desarrollo de vacunas consta de dos partes, la fase preclínica (experimentos en células, tejidos y modelos animales) y la fase clínica (ensayos en humanos).\nLa fase clínica involucra 5 fases de investigación:\nPREFASE I: Fase utilizada para describir los ensayos exploratorios realizados antes de los ensayos tradicionales de fase 1, para investigar si afectan al organismo y de qué forma. Implica una exposición humana muy limitada y no tiene objetivos terapéuticos.\nFASE I: Se enfoca en la seguridad de la vacuna. Se prueba en un número pequeño de voluntarios saludables. Se determinan los efectos no deseados más severos y cómo se metaboliza y elimina del cuerpo.\nFASE II: En esta fase se reúnen datos preliminares de cómo trabaja la vacuna en personas que tienen ciertas enfermedades o condiciones de salud.\nFASE III: Fase en donde se describen ensayos clínicos que recopilan más información sobre la seguridad y efectividad mediante el estudio del efecto en diferentes poblaciones, diferentes dosis y al usarse en combinación con otros medicamentos. Estos estudios generalmente involucran un número mayor de participantes.\nFASE IV: En esta fase se describen los estudios realizados después de que se ha aprobado para su comercialización. Estos estudios recopilan información sobre la seguridad, eficacia o uso óptimo. Además, incluyen requisitos de posventa y compromisos que son requeridos y acordados por el patrocinador del estudio.\nPara la enfermedad COVID-19, las vacunas candidatas más adelantadas al momento se encuentran en las fases I o II.

Las medidas de control estudiadas han variado tanto en la escala de severidad como en la temporalidad frente al brote epidémico en cada país. Estas variaciones en las medidas de control producen un efecto en la evolución de la tasa de contagio que se puede medir con la metodología que desarrollamos, denominada \u0026ldquo;ajustes SIR dinámicos data-driven\u0026rdquo;. Los parámetros considerados en nuestro análisis y evaluación de las acciones realizadas en cada país son:\n Semana de llegada a la cumbre del brote epidémico. Implementación oportuna y efectiva de las medidas de control. Diseño de una estrategia respaldada por un sistema de salud fortalecido. Letalidad de COVID-19 en el país en la fase de declive del brote.  De este análisis concluimos que la implementación oportuna o tardía de algunas medidas de control establecidas por los gobiernos tienen un impacto en la evolución, la intensidad y la duración del brote epidémico en cada país.

Además de estar atentos a las medidas sanitarias que ha implementado el gobierno, hemos analizamos los datos que diariamente se reportan con respecto a la epidemia en el país desde la perspectiva de distintas áreas de la ciencia y con el rigor que como científicos/as hemos adquirido durante nuestra formación. Esta labor la hemos hecho motivados por nuestro compromiso con la verdad y la generación de conocimiento, que en un momento de crisis como el que vivimos actualmente, debe ser más que nunca un esfuerzo para el beneficio de la sociedad. Es por ello, que como comunidad respaldamos las recomendaciones y alertas que la OMS ha emitido para la lucha mundial contra esta enfermedad que ha provocado la muerte de cientos de miles de personas alrededor del mundo.\nComo científicos/as e investigadores/as mexicanos queremos expresar nuestro rotundo rechazo ante los hechos ocurridos la noche del 17 de abril de 2020, cuando durante la emisión del noticiero Hechos de TV Azteca, se presentaron los reportajes titulados “Cifras falsas del López-Gatell. Conferencias y dichos, se vuelven irrelevantes” (sic) y “Engaño de López-Gatell” en los que se presentó una interpretación tendenciosa y técnicamente inadecuada de una entrevista concedida por el titular de la Subsecretaría de Prevención y Promoción de la Salud al periódico estadounidense The Wall Street Journal (Nota 1). Apoyado en estos reportajes, el conductor Javier Alatorre Soria conminaba a la población a desatender las medidas de prevención y distanciamiento social promovidas no sólo por la Secretaría de Salud de México, sino también por organismos internacionales como la Organización Panamericana de la Salud y Organización Mundial de la Salud, en un intento por contener la pandemia provocada por el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\nLlamar a la población a desatender e ignorar las recomendaciones del subsecretario Dr. Hugo López Gatell puede costar la vida de miles de mexicanos. Muertes que pueden ser evitadas con la puesta en práctica de las medidas de control propuestas por la Secretaría Salud. El distanciamiento social es la única manera de lograr disminuir el contagio masivo entre la población y de esta manera evitar que los sistemas de salud nacionales se vean desbordados y podamos salvar vidas.\nDesde diferentes latitudes, hemos enfocado nuestra atención hacia la estrategia de Contingencia COVID-19 llevada a cabo en México por el grupo multidisciplinario integrado desde la Secretaría de Salud. Si bien reconocemos (y vemos con preocupación) las deficiencias del Sistema Nacional de Salud en México y las carencias en las que debemos hacer frente a esta crisis sanitaria, consideramos que la estrategia planteada ha sido bien encaminada en las circunstancias actuales del país.\nConsideramos que el mensaje de la Secretaría de Salud ha sido riguroso y transparente. El conteo de personas infectadas en México, y en todo el mundo, es una estimación. Por razones prácticas y de costo no es factible aplicar pruebas a la toda la población. Distintos países han adoptado políticas diferentes en cuanto al número de pruebas hechas, pero en ninguno las bases de datos son exactas, incluso en aquellos donde se han realizado un mayor número de pruebas. La estrategia seguida por la Secretaría de Salud es un sistema de monitoreo llamado centinela (Nota 2) que de manera sistemática realiza un muestreo de la población afectada. Esta estrategia permite estimar a partir de una muestra pequeña la población total. Ello de ninguna manera debe interpretarse como un engaño a la población, sino como lo que es: una muestra. En estadística una muestra es un subconjunto de datos representativo de la población total a partir del cual es posible inferir de manera no sesgada las propiedades del total. El análisis de la muestra nos permite también inferir tendencias y, como en muchas ramas de la ciencia, se requiere trabajar con muestras ante la imposibilidad de medir la totalidad de la población.\nPor lo antes expuesto, hacemos un llamado a la sociedad a seguir las recomendaciones de la Secretaría de Salud, ya que de no hacerlo podría costar la vida de miles de personas. Como miembros de la comunidad científica y como parte de la comunidad mexicana, exigimos que Javier Alatorre Soria, a nombre del equipo involucrado en dichos reportajes, se retracte de manera pública y a título personal con la sociedad mexicana por la profunda falta de ética e irresponsabilidad profesional con la que se condujo.\nFinalmente, conminamos a todos los sectores de la sociedad a conducirse con ética y responsabilidad social en todos y cada uno de los comunicados que emitan mientras la epidemia esté activa (ya sea a título personal, o de manera institucional). Es responsabilidad de todos velar por la salud y el bienestar de los mexicanos ante esta epidemia.\nNotas\n https://www.wsj.com/articles/senior-mexican-health-official-questions-how-deadly-coronavirus-really-is-11587133043 Modelo centinela de la Organización Panaméricana de la Salud y de Organización Mundial de la Salud  Aclaración: Los datos recabados no se utilizarán con ningún otro propósito fuera del alcance de esta carta y serán posteriormente eliminados\n","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"f5fffa9773e4950be97dbf2b35051cbf","permalink":"/post/carta-alatorre/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/carta-alatorre/","section":"post","summary":"Carta contra declaraciones de Javier Alatorre","tags":["COVID19","coronavirus","México"],"title":"Carta contra declaraciones de Javier Alatorre","type":"post"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"6102fbcd20c45af61ad7780335133772","permalink":"/project/noticias-falsas/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/noticias-falsas/","section":"project","summary":"Publicaciones sobre Fake News","tags":null,"title":"Fake news","type":"project"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero","Adán José-García"],"categories":[],"content":"Mapas interactivos de la evolución del brote epidémico COVID-19 en México por entidades.\n1.

Entender y predecir el comportamiento de una epidemia es una de las cosas que le interesa conocer a la epidemiología. Existen distintas estrategias para conseguir entender esto. Una en particular es mediante el modelo matemático determinista desarrollado originalmente por Kermack y McKendrick (1927), el cual consiste en asumir que el comportamiento de la población susceptible a contagio ($S$), infectada ($I$) y recuperada ($R$), está dado por el siguiente sistema de ecuaciones diferenciales ordinarias:\n$$\\begin{align} \\dfrac{dS}{dt} \u0026 = -\\beta S I \\\\\n\\dfrac{dI}{dt} \u0026 = \\beta S I - \\lambda I \\\\\n\\dfrac{dR}{dt} \u0026 = \\gamma I \\end{align}$$\ndonde $S + I + R = 1$. Estas ecuaciones representan el número de individuos por intervalo de tiempo en cada una de las poblaciones consideradas. El significado de cada parámetro corresponde a características particulares de la enfermedad:\n $\\beta$ es la tasa de infección. Este parámetro nos indica la probabilidad de que una persona susceptibles resulte infectada. $\\gamma$ es la tasa de recuperación. Este parámetro está dado por el tiempo promedio que tarda una persona en dejar de ser infecciosa y conseguir la inmunidad.  Encontrar la solución al sistema de ecuaciones mencionado equivale a calcular el cumulativo de nuevos casos de infectados y recuperados que aparecen diariamente.\nHay un parámetro en epidemiología que nos marca la dinámica de la enfermedad y está asociado al poder reproductivo de la enfermedad. Este parámetro se le conoce como el ritmo reproductivo básico, que para el modelo SIR está dado por:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma},$$\nSi $R_0 \u0026lt; 1$, la enfermedad muere después de un largo periodo. Si $R_0 \u0026gt; 1$, la infección puede llegar a propagarse ampliamente entre una población. El caso particular de $R_0 = 1$ indica que cada persona infectada va a contagiar a una sola persona\nEvolución de una infección de acuerdo con el modelo SIR Al resolver el sistema de ecuaciones descritos arriba, podemos estimar cómo será el comportamiento de la enfermedad en una población en particular a través de los días y predecir momentos clave de la infección. Como ejemplo tomaremos una población de 1000 individuos, de los cuales asumiremos que al día 0 tenemos 1 infectado.\nFigura: Soluciones del modelo SIR para tres valores de $\\beta$.\nEn este experimento hemos usado $\\gamma = 10$ y $R_0 = 2, 3, 4$, que corresponden a $\\beta = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4$ (líneas sólidas, discontinuas y de guiones y puntos, respectivamente). Las líneas de color rojo representan a la población de infectados. En este experimento hemos asumidos que los parámetros $\\gamma$ y $R_0$ (o en su defecto $\\beta$) son constantes en el tiempo.\nLas etapas más importantes de la enfermedad vienen dados por las líneas rojas (individuos infectados). El punto máximo de estas líneas nos dicen cuál y cuándo será el máximo de infectados. El parámetro $\\beta$, como hemos dicho antes, nos indica la probabilidad de un individuo sano pase a la población de infectados. Si, por ejemplo, un virus es altamente transmisible y desconocido como el SARS-CoV2, el valor de $\\beta$ será alto si la población no toma medidas que reduzcan las probabilidades de entrar en contacto con el virus; en otras palabras, si no se quedan en casa.\n","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"c437d9df7c98f617c7e47eab92e5036e","permalink":"/post/modelo-sir/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/modelo-sir/","section":"post","summary":"Descripción del modelo SIR empleado en epidemiología para modelar el comportamiento de una enfermedad infecciosa.","tags":["COVID19","coronavirus","México"],"title":" Descripción del Modelo SIR","type":"post"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero"],"categories":[],"content":"En fechas recientes aparecieron noticias 📰 con titulares como: \u0026ldquo;Científicos de la NASA descubren un universo paralelo con el tiempo invertido\u0026rdquo; 🌌⏳ Esa noticia es falsa 🙅 ya que no existe evidencia suficiente.\nANITA (ANtarctic Impulsive Transient Antenta) es un conjunto de antenas suspendidas de un globo de helio, diseñaas para detectar ondas de radio inducidas por el efecto Askaryan cuando neutrinos de altas energías atraviesan el hielo antártico. ANITA a antenita que detectó las particulitas anómalas 📡. Nuestro equipo de físicos 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬 se dio a la tarea de reunir la información completa para explicarte por qué no existen los universos paralelos.\nANITA detectó 📡 dos rayos cósmicos anómalos. La explicación que se dio a dicho suceso fue que para que estos rayos existieran como tal, se debía romper la simetría CPT (carga, paridad, inversión temporal) ➕➖🔃⌛ ó ¡que existían los universos paralelos! 🌌 Ambas hipótesis son falsas y te explicamos por qué.\nPrimero que nada, ¿a qué se refieren con un rayo cósmico anómalo? A uno que tendría que provenir de un neutrino tau ¡que fuese partícula de Majorana y que además tuvieran una enorme masa y su quiralidad fuera dextrógira!\nNada sencillo el asunto 🤔 Vamos por partes.\n1️⃣ La simetría CPT se debe cumplir para mantener la invariancia de las leyes dinámicas que rigen la física.\n2️⃣ Un neutrino es una partícula subatómica ⚛ con masa muy pequeña, sin carga y cuya interacción con la materia es casi indetectable.\n3️⃣ La quiralidad 🤲 de los neutrinos tau es levógira ⏪ y la de su anti-partícula (los anti-neutrinos tau) es dextrógira ⏩\n4️⃣ Una partícula de Majorana es una partícula que es su propia anti-partícula. Desde aquí ya se puede ver lo complicado del asunto, ¿no?\n¡Compliquémoslo un poco más! La energía ⚡️ de las dos señales observadas 👀 era muy grande, del orden de medio exaelectronvoltio. Además, su polarización se encontraba invertida. Hechos que contradicen a lo establecido con el modelo estándar. ¿De qué estamos hablando realmente?\nSigamos con los hechos científicos:\n5️⃣ El modelo estándar de la física de partículas es una teoría que describe la materia y las interacciones entre sus partículas elementales.\n6️⃣ El neutrino pertenece a las partículas elementales llamadas leptones en el modelo estándar.\n7️⃣ Un exaelectronvolt (EeV) es una magnitud de energía con un orden de 1x10^18 eV, ¡esos son muchoooos ceros!\n8️⃣ En el modelo estándar se define que la energía del neutrino tau debe ser menor a 0.18x10^9 eV ⚡️ Vemos entonces que las señales exceden los lineamientos del modelo estándar. Para que se cumpla la simetría CPT, tendrían que existir otro tanto de neutrinos pesados que también fueran partículas de Majorana y que al interactuar con la materia en la tierra 🌎, se desintegraran en un bosón de Higgs y un neutrino tau que ANITA 📡 detectaría ¡Uff! ¡Desglosemos!\n9️⃣ Que sean partículas de Majorana implica que el neutrino sería en sí mismo partícula y antipartícula ⤴️⤵️\n🔟 Que fuesen más partículas de Majorana y que se desintegre en un boson de Higgs 🎇, explica la repentina aparición de una masa tan grande para un neutrino.\n1️⃣1️⃣ ¿Qué es un boson de Higgs? El bosón de Higgs es una partícula elemental del modelo estándar que fue descubierta en 2013 y que explica la masividad de las partículas mismas. Al escuchar todo lo que se requiere para cumplir con la simetría CPT y el modelo estándar, la propuesta de la existencia de Universos Paralelos para justificar los datos suena más excitante, ¿no?\nPues si existiesen los universos paralelos 🔃, ¡sería muy fácil poner al dichoso neutrino dextrógiro e inexistente en un universo paralelo donde simplemente el tiempo corriera hacia atrás⌛️⏳! ¡Y así no se incumpliría con el modelo estándar!\nPero esto no es posible porque según la física relativista, si ponemos un observador en el universo y otro en un universo paralelo, ambos se desplazarían temporalmente hacia adelante desde su marco de referencia. Es decir, el tiempo corre en el mismo sentido para ambos universos.\nSin embargo, en un marco de referencia absoluto la flecha del tiempo tendría que ir hacia el futuro⏩⏩ para el universo y hacia el pasado ⏪⏪ para el antiuniverso (universo paralelo) y eso no es posible ¡porque no existen los marcos de referencia absolutos!\n","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"eeb642ae38ee8dee9b650443aa0d9156","permalink":"/post/anita/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/anita/","section":"post","summary":"ANITA y la teoría de los universos paralelos","tags":["infografía"],"title":"ANITA y la teoría de los universos paralelos","type":"post"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero"],"categories":[],"content":"Creemos que la campaña lanzada por el grupo Alianza por el Valor Estratégico de las marcas no es solidaria ni empática.

El mayor riesgo de transmisión de enfermedades zoonóticas se produce en la interfaz entre el ser humano y los animales a través de la exposición directa o indirecta a los animales, los productos derivados de estos (carne, leche, huevos, etc) o su entorno.\nSegún el Programa de Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente, el 60% de las enfermedades infecciosas humanas tiene origen animal. Este porcentaje alcanza el 75% en el caso de las enfermedades llamadas “emergentes”, por ejemplos: ébola, VIH, gripes aviarias, SRAS, zika y ahora el Covid-19.\nEl virus SARS-CoV-2, causante de la enfermedad COVID-19, tiene un 96% de semejanza con el virus RaTG13, que infecta a la especie de murciélago Rhinolophus affinis. Esta no sería la primera vez que una enfermedad causada por un virus de la familia de los coronavirus ocurre a través de transferencia zoonótica. Las epidemias de SARS en el 2002 y de MERS en 2012, tuvieron su origen en cepas de virus que también infectan a los murciélagos y que usaron como intermediarios a otros animales como la civeta y al camello.\nLa emergencia de enfermedades zoonóticas se facilita enormemente por la constante interacción entre las especies y el desequilibrio de su entorno, lo que causa “puentes” para llegar a los humanos. Esta interacción está mediada entre otras cosas por la destrucción de su hábitat (deforestación, agricultura, urbanización), el tráfico irregular de fauna silvestre y la explotación animal desmedida.\nLa emergencia de enfermedades zoonóticas se facilita enormemente por la constante interacción entre las especies y el desequilibrio de su entorno, lo que causa “puentes” para llegar a los humanos.

Somos dos grupos que trabajamos en colaboración, el colectivo de Científicos Mexicanos en el extranjero y el grupo ConCiencia Social: Laboratorio Científico, Social y de Políticas Públicas (ver miembros al final de la nota). Conformamos un grupo multidisciplinario que nos encontramos en diferentes países, por supuesto México, España, Reino Unido, Portugal, Austria, Italia, Francia y Estados Unidos de América (EUA).\nContexto Estamos viviendo una pandemia provocada por el virus COVID-19 cuyo primer brote se detectó en la provincia de Hubei en China, marcando el día cero de este brote por un nuevo coronavirus el día 19 de enero de 2020 con 216 infectados. Desde entonces el virus COVID-19 se ha propagado a nivel internacional lo que ha ocasionado que al día de hoy se tengan registrado brotes de COVID-19 en 178 países. La intensidad y evolución de cada brote epidémico ha variado en cada localidad como lo manifiestan las curvas de infectados, recuperados y defunciones, que podemos consultar en la red de forma actualizada y confiable como lo es el repositorio de la universidad Johns Hopkins University. Además de múltiples bases de datos disponibles, en partular la que usamos para este trabajo sobre las medidas de control que los diversos gobiernos han implementado con fechas actualizadas y que es elaborada por la universidad de Oxford \u0026ndash; Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker.\nPlanteamiento original y motivación Hemos seguido de cerca y experimentado directamente las medidas de control que han sido implementadas en los diferentes países en donde nos encontramos además de haber analizado el caso de China y podemos percatarnos de los diferentes binomios (medidas de control, mitigación del brote) que han sido implementados con mayor o menor éxito en los distintos países.\nEl planteamiento que nos hicimos fue analizar la viabilidad de implementar un modelo matemático y una metodología que nos permitiera dar pautas a la sociedad mexicana en estos momentos y responder con base en parámetros medibles si estas medidas son útiles y eficientes para contener y mitigar el brote epidémico. Resultando que nuestro modelo es capaz de responder un con un contundente SÍ, las medidas de control diseñadas e implementadas en este momento y en este estadio de la epidemia si tuvieron y tendrán un efecto en el periodo de la evolución del brote epidémico.\nConcretamente nuestros objetivos son:  Mostrar comportamiento decreciente de la tasa de contagio efectiva medida en los diferentes países analizados después de un periodo de haber aplicado las medidas de control. Mostrar que la efectividad de estas medidas depende tanto del orden y la temporalidad dentro de las etapas del brote, así como de la severidad con las que fueron aplicadas y la duración de las mismas. Resaltar que la elaboración de una estrategia adecuada a cada país para la implementación de estas medidas es crucial para la contención y mitigación del brote epidémico.  Modelo matemático SIR La base de este trabajo es un modelo clásico de 1927 ideado por los médicos escoceses W. O. Kermack y A. G. McKendrick, el cual emplea un sistema de ecuaciones diferenciales a fin de detallar cómo surge un brote infeccioso, su crecimiento, en qué momento alcanza su máximo y cómo después decae, todo ello a partir de dos parámetros: uno biológico \\gamma y otro social \\beta:\n  Parámetro \\gamma: Es un parámetro biológico que está relacionado con el número de días en que tarda un humano infectado en recuperarse y es contagioso.\n  Parámetro \\beta: Es un parámetro social que considera cómo se transmite el COVID-19 y cómo puedes disminuir su contagio implementando medidas de control de diferente corte que ayuden a modificar y limitar la interacción entre humanos.\n  Estas medidas son de una gama muy amplia que van desde medidas que no frenan la actividad laboral y social en las ciudades, como por ejemplo: incluir hábitos higiénicos como el lavado de manos y el no tocarse la cara, la limpieza de superficies y hábitos de interacción social como la sana distancia entre las personas, hasta las medidas más restrictivas y severas que impactan en el desarrollo laboral y de restricciones en la movilidad de la sociedad, como por ejemplo lo es el aislamiento en determinados casos, hacer home office, entre otras y las que se incluyen en una etapa más avanzada de la epidemia como por ejemplo: cierre de centros de trabajo no esenciales y cuarentena prolongada. Además, dentro de esta gama de medidas están las de corte monetario y fiscal que son muy necesarias en un brote de larga duración para proteger a la población más desprotegida. Recordemos que México es un país que debe enfrentar la Contingencia Covid-19 en las condiciones adversas con el 50% de su población en la pobreza, no bancarizada y con un sistema de salud precario.\nEl modelo depende igualmente de la población total, y de ciertos valores iniciales que son el número inicial de infectados, de defunciones y de recuperados al día cero del brote. El modelo predice el número de personas infectadas y recuperados a diferentes tiempos.\nEl modelo anterior también conocido como modelo SIR es adecuado para analizar este tipo de brotes epidémicos ya que describe a un buen nivel de precisión la evolución de un brote provocado por un nuevo virus en una región. Es un modelo simplificado respecto al número de parámetros que utiliza, son sólo dos parámetros \\beta y \\gamma con una clara interpretación. Otra ventaja de usar un modelo simplificado es para una correcta y efectiva implementación de la metodología que se usa para el ajuste de parámetros a lo largo de diferentes periodos del brote que puede ser aplicada a múltiples países.\nAdemás, este modelo fue utilizado en el 2009 para modelar el brote epidémico de la influenza H1N1 en la Ciudad de México y aplicar medidas de control efectivas para mitigar el brote, el artículo puede consultarse en: Modelling of the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak in Mexico City, April-May 2009, with control sanitary measures de los autores G Cruz-Pacheco et al.\nMetodología del Ajuste con intervalos variables Un modelo estático no nos sirve para estudiar la evolución de la epidemia, dado que la mayoría de los países han implementado medidas de mitigación, entonces podemos esperar que la evolución tenga una tasa efectiva de contagio que varía en el tiempo y en particular esperamos que disminuya en el tiempo. Lo que hicimos fue ajustar el modelo variando el intervalo de tiempo del ajuste para poder identificar si las medidas han tenido impacto en la tasa de contagio efectiva. Realizamos este procedimiento por el número de intervalos de tiempo que nos indique nuestros datos.\nDescripción técnica de la metodología: A fin de ajustar el modelo sobre los datos, usamos una minimización del estimador de \\Xi^2 cuadrado asociado a uno algoritmo de optimización siguiendo el método de Powell. Este método no requiere que nuestro estimador sea diferenciable al contrario de un método de gradiente. En nuestro caso preciso no hay manera de definir correctamente la matriz de covarianza razón por la cual usamos una matriz unitaria. Elegimos esta convención para no dar más importancia a datos particulares pudiendo sesgar el valor de los parámetros estimados. Sin embargo, por esta misma razón no podemos extraer el error de los parámetros estimados sino enfocarnos en el valor de mayor verosimilitud.\nDescripción de la metodología aplicada a cada país y visualización de los plots: Para entender la metodología podemos imaginar un caso hipotético donde una epidemia empieza en un país y el gobierno no aplica ninguna medida de mitigación, entonces la epidemia seguirá su desarrollo natural determinado únicamente por beta y gama. Lo que podemos hacer en este caso es ajustar el modelo y medir o determinar el valor del parámetro beta que mejor ajusta los datos, un buen ajuste implicaría que nuestra predicción del modelo y observación son muy similares o idénticas.\nUna vez que encontramos el modelo que mejor describe nuestras observaciones podemos evaluar cómo evolucionará la infección con el tiempo. Entonces, lo que ocurriría es que en un breve tiempo se afectaría un porcentaje importante de la población. Sabemos hoy que la tasa de enfermos que requieren hospitalización es aproximadamente 10% y la tasa de mortalidad es de 4-5%. Este caso ideal no toma en cuenta las condiciones del sistema de salud, entonces supone que sin importar el número de enfermos los hospitales podrán atenderlos. Si suponemos que el sistema de salud solo puede atender un número limitado de enfermos, entonces se habla de saturación del sistema de salud e incremento de la tasa de mortalidad. Por tanto el interés de los gobiernos por implementar medidas de mitigación para intentar reducir la tasa de contagio y por ende el número de pacientes que requerirán atención hospitalaria y de cuidados intensivos al mismo tiempo y de esta forma administrar los recurso de salud de manera óptima.\nEste análisis fue aplicado para 5 países: China, Italia, España, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y México. Para poder asociar los cambios en la tasa de contagio con las medidas de mitigación realizamos una investigación de las fechas y medidas de mitigación implementadas, así como la efectividad y severidad de las medidas en los diferentes paises. En particular nos centramos en analizar el impacto en el parámetro beta, de las estrategias de mitigación seguidas en los diferentes países y esperamos que entre más efectivas las medidas, más baja sea la tasa de contagio.\nLimitaciones del modelo El modelo no integra una dimensión espacial y considera que la propagación del brote es homogénea. Entonces en los casos donde una ciudad o unas cuantas ciudades tienen un brote de distinta intensidad y temporalidad, la interpretación del modelo será un promedio de los efectos de cada uno de los brotes en las ciudades, lo que llamamos tasa de contagio efectiva.\nDatos Los datos los extraemos del siguiente repositorio:\nhttps://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19\nEste es un repositorio creado desde 2019 para el “Nuevo panel visual de coronavirus (Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard)” que es operado por the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science y Engineering (JHU CSSE). Esta base es actualizada por el Equipo ESRI Living Atlas y el Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). Las condiciones iniciales y el periodo de aplicación del modelo fueron determinados mediante los datos reportados de cada país. Se considero el día cero de la epidemia en cada país como el día en que el acumulado de infectados rebaso la cifra de 100 infectados.\nResultados Este análisis fue aplicado para 5 países: China, Italia, España, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y México. Para poder asociar los cambios en la tasa de contagio con las medidas de mitigación realizamos una investigación de las fechas y medidas de mitigación implementadas, así como la efectividad y severidad de las medidas en los diferentes países. En particular nos centramos en analizar el impacto en el parámetro beta, de las estrategias de mitigación seguidas en los diferentes países y esperamos que entre más efectivas las medidas, más baja sea la tasa de contagio.\nChina Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en CHINA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nEl brote epidémico en China fue detectado y declarado el 19 de enero con 216 casos confirmados. Debido a que el brote se encontraba ya en una fase de crecimiento acelerado, se implementaron medidas de control muy severas a nivel regional en toda la provincia de Hubei.\nLas medidas adoptadas a nivel regional permitieron mitigar la intensidad del brote inicial. Particularmente, al día 10 del inicio del brote se observa un pequeño decrecimiento en la tasa de contagio. Las medidas de control no se relajaron durante los próximos 30 días. Este efecto de las medidas puede apreciarse en que los valores de beta decrecen conforme pasa el tiempo y que el efecto de “aplanamiento” se observa en los escenarios evolutivos de la epidemia por el modelo SIR. Observamos que la aplicación contundente y efectiva de las diferentes medidas de control en la región del brote (y algunas otras preventivas a nivel nacional) ayudaron a concentrar y frenar el brote epidémico, y por ello no fue necesario extender estas mismas medidas a nivel nacional.\nChina implementó una estrategia efectiva para mitigar el brote de COVID19 y mantenerlo en la región de Hubei por un tiempo prolongado, suficiente para que no fuera propagado en el resto del país, donde el balance final de defunciones a la fecha es de 3,316.\nItalia Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en ITALIA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nItalia fue el primer país en presentar un brote de gran intensidad en Europa, brote que lamentablemente a la fecha sigue su curso costando muchas vidas en su población y un golpe terrible a los trabajadores de la salud en donde su capacidad hospitalaria y de atención fue rebasada en la fase de crecimiento acelerado del brote.\nItalia detectó el inicio del brote el día 24 de Febrero con 132 casos confirmados en su mayoría localizados en la Región de Lombardía. No fueron aplicadas mayores medidas de control para contener o mitigar el brote previamente a excepción de controles de viajes internacionales de corte severo al día 30 de enero, tampoco hubo campaña de información previa. Se observa que las medidas de control comienzan a ser implementadas el día 4 de marzo, 8 días después del día declarado como el inicio de la epidemia en la fase de crecimiento rápido de la epidemia y no son de corte severas en la región del brote sino más bien son de carácter relajado y gradual, por tanto podemos esperar que el impacto de las medidas sea mucho menor que en China. Los resultados verifican la intuición y encontramos que la tasa de contacto que podemos extraer de los datos en distintos periodos del brote ha decrecido más lentamente por ende el brote está teniendo una duración más larga en comparación con China y también se han registrado un mayor número de muertes, siendo el 19 de marzo el día en que lamentablemente Italia superó el número de defunciones por Covid19 que hasta el momento había reportado china esto ocurre a los 19 días del inicio del brote en Italia. El caso de Italia es importante pues es el primer país en describir una evolución a un escenario muy difícil en donde se supera el punto de la capacidad del sistema de salud, esto es la saturación de los sistemas de salud que igualmente aumentan la tasa de mortalidad y a la fecha Italia ha presentado 12 428 muertes. Por el momento no hemos incluido análisis de esta componente del fenómeno pero es algo que potencialmente integraremos al análisis.\nEspaña Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en ESPAÑA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nEspaña es otro país que hemos incluido en el estudio, pues nuevamente el binomio (medidas de control, mitigación de la curva de infectados) es muy interesante. España detectó el brote epidémico el 3 de marzo con 114 infectados. La única medida de control, efectuada previamente al brote, fue una campaña de información con poca difusión. El día 9 de marzo con 589 contagios es que se aplicaron medidas de control regionales (Nivel 1) y el 10 de marzo con 4231 infectados es que se aplican acciones muy severas en todo el país. El impacto que estas acciones tuvieron en la curva de infectados, se vieron reflejadas desde el día 15 de marzo, luego el día 21 de marzo y finalmente el día 28 de marzo en donde claramente observamos una inflexión en la curva y el parámetro beta de tasa de contacto efectiva medido pasó de 0.42 a 0.29, 0.26 y 0.17 respectivamente. Al día 6 de abril se han registrado lamentablemente 11,198 defunciones. El 26 de marzo, España superó a CHINA en el número de defunciones por COVID-19. Esto es a los 20 días del inicio del brote.\nDe lo anterior podemos inferir que las medidas de control atendidas por la sociedad española están logrando mitigar el brote de COVID-19. Esperamos que de no relajarse las medidas y con la obediencia y solidaridad de todos los españoles logren que finalmente el brote empiece su fase de declive.\nEspaña ha librado una difícil batalla contra el COVID-19, su población tuvo que aprender a la mala como combatir la transmisión del virus y lograr mitigar el brote en una fase difícil. Respetar la sana distancia, convencerse de la relevancia del confinamiento en un principo y de la importancia de mantener el correcto lavado de manos y el uso correct del alcohol en gel fue difícil. Ha sido una curva de aprendizaje dura y que ha costado muchas vidas y grandes esfuerzos principalmente de su cuerpo de salud pero finalmente la sociedad española ha aprendido.\nEstados Unidos Figura: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en EUA para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nCon respecto a Estados Unidos, lo que observamos del análisis es que no se ha observado disminución de la tasa de contagio a los 21 días de haber iniciado el brote. Lo que indica que las medidas de control se aplicaron de manera muy tardía en el brote y no han tenido ningún efecto en la tasa de contacto. El país se encuentra en un momento de crecimiento acelerado del número de infectados y la ausencia de medidas severas homogéneas o coherentes a lo largo del país para la contención de la epidemia parecen apuntar a que la tasa de contacto no tendrá cambios significativos en las semanas próximas. Características de estados Unidos que deben tomarse en cuenta al realizar el análisis es su gran conectividad, su población relativamente grande, y la ausencia de medidas coherentes a lo largo del país de contención de la epidemia, que se han presentado múltiples brotes en el país, sobre todo en toda la costa este y en California lo cual no permite que podamos asumir una evolución homogénea por lo que pensamos hacer en el futuro análisis regionales.\n[Trabajo en progreso \u0026hellip;]\nMéxico Figuras: Análisis sobre el impacto de las medidas de control implementadas en MÉXICO para tratar de mitigar el brote epidémico COVID-19.\nEn México en contraste con el resto de países que hemos analizado hasta el momento como son China, Italia, España, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos, demuestra haber preparado una estrategia con suficiente antelación ante la llegada del brote de COVID-19 al país y considerando las condiciones con las cuales debía hacer frente a la epidemia, contemplando indudablemente las características sociales, económicas y de su sistema de salud.\nDiseñó muy bien una estrategia definida por Fase 1, 2 y 3. Dando inicio a la Fase 1 el día 23 de Enero , esto es 56 días antes del inicio del brote. Todas las medidas definidas e implementadas en la Fase 1 repercutieron positivamente para lograr mitigar la intensidad del brote esto, de acuerdo al los datos arrojados por el estudio lo podemos identificar en que el ajuste del parámetro de contacto efectivo es de beta=0.3 al inicio del brote, el cual es mucho menor al beta=0.4 reportado en las mediciones en China Italia y España. Al día 9-10 del inicio del brote comienza a vislumbrarse una inflexión en la curva a un estado de menor crecimiento y su evolución responderá al impacto del correcto comportamiento de la ciudadanía y gobierno para acatar las medidas impuestas en fase 2.\nCon la evolución a un mayor número de días será posible medir el impacto de las medidas implementadas por la secretaría de salud y gobierno del día 24 de marzo con el inicio de la fase 2 y el día 30 de marzo con el cierre de centros de trabajo no esenciales. Se puede esperar que si la ciudadanía sigue las recomendaciones la tasa de contacto será mucho menor a 0.3 de no relajarse las medidas y aplicarse por el tiempo estimado por la secretaría de salud y gobierno.\nConsideramos que México ha diseñado una estrategia y se ha anticipado adecuadamente a la llegada del brote, iniciando una fuerte campaña de información 8 semanas previas al inicio del mismo. Se han difundido oportunamente recomendaciones sanitarias que incluyen medidas de higiene y de la jornada de sana distancia para disminuir la transmisión del virus. Además, las medidas más severas de limitación de la movilidad han sido aplicadas oportunamente en la fase previa al inicio del crecimiento acelerado del brote, también ya en la fase de crecimiento acelerado se han anunciado nuevas medidas que incluyen el cierre de centros de trabajo no esenciales hasta el 30 de abril. Podemos esperar que si no se relajan estas medidas y son adoptadas por la mayoría de los habitantes del país se logre reducir sustancialmente la tasa de contagio efectiva en las próximas semanas. Esta semana será clave para valorar el impacto de las medidas pero los resultados preliminares parecen prometedores. En la figura mostramos dos proyecciones en 2 escenarios diferentes un escenario donde se tiene una mitigación efectiva que seguiría la trayectoria de países como China y un escenario menos prometedor donde la tasa de contagio decrece como Italia. Estas predicciones también las iremos actualizando.\nColaboradores en este trabajo Coordinadores: Rosa María Vargas-Magaña (U. de Edimburgo), Sebastien Fromenteau (ICF-UNAM), Mariana Vargas-Magaña (IF-UNAM), Adán José-García y Jesús Misráyim Rueda Becerril.\nLaboratorio ConCiencia Social: Rosa María Vargas-Magaña, Sebastien Fromenteau, Mariana Vargas Magaña, German Vargas Magaña, Monica Bocanegra, Germán Vargas Larios, Rosa María Magaña Álvarez.\nColectivo Científicos Mexicanos en el Extranjero: Adán José-García, Andrea Elizabeth Gutiérrez Quezada, María Abigail Jiménez Franco, Abril Armenta Franco, Adriana Azucena Cortés Gómez, Francisco Cuéllar Pérez, Jesús Misráyim Rueda Becerril, Marcela Martin del Campo Fierro, Nelly Arcos Martínez.\n","date":1586044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586044800,"objectID":"9e0e25e29f3e7772aed1bbed6297a727","permalink":"/post/covid19/","publishdate":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid19/","section":"post","summary":"Impacto de las medidas de control implementadas para mitigar del brote epidémico del COVID-19","tags":["COVID19","coronavirus","México"],"title":"Medidas de control ante el brote COVID-19 y su impacto en la evolución del brote epidémico","type":"post"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"6c6ba6301043db905c138d65a8fc5f7a","permalink":"/project/infografias/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/infografias/","section":"project","summary":"Infografías sobre diversos temas científicos.","tags":["infografía","coronavirus"],"title":"Infografías","type":"project"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"2c9cabcfbaeaad01aa75ce607cf4a717","permalink":"/project/cartas-comunicados/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cartas-comunicados/","section":"project","summary":"Listado de cartas y comunicados.","tags":["CONACyT"],"title":"Cartas y Comunicados","type":"project"},{"authors":["Científicæs Mexicanæs en el Extranjero","Adán José-García"],"categories":[],"content":"Resumen Somos un grupo de doctores Investigadores Mexicanos en el Extranjero realizando un Posdoctorado financiado por CONACyT y una institución receptora. Nuestro trabajo consiste en desarrollar proyectos de investigación en universidades internacionales y además, colaborar con programas de posgrado en universidades o centros de investigación en México. La duración del financiamiento posdoctoral generalmente es de 2 años, donde los avances del primer año son evaluados para su renovación a un segundo periodo. La evaluación y aprobación de estos proyectos es realizada por integrantes del Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI).\nEste año CONACyT renovó menos del 35% de los proyectos aprobados en el año 2018. La interrupción de estos proyectos afecta directamente a las investigaciones en curso, y también impide continuar colaborando con las universidades en el extranjero y con los programas de posdoctorado en México. La causa principal para descontinuar estos proyectos se debe a inconsistencias e irregularidades en la plataforma de captura del CONACyT y en los lineamientos de la convocatoria oficial. Por ejemplo, un mínimo de 30 solicitudes fueron evaluadas y aceptadas por los evaluadores del SNI, pero fueron rechazadas por el CONACyT por no incluir la identificación del investigador anfitrión, a pesar que este documento ya había sido proporcionado desde el inicio del proyecto de investigación y en el portal no se desplegó un espacio para adjuntarlo.\nSolicitamos una evaluación objetiva al CONACYT, para que los proyectos de investigación sean evaluados para su continuidad basándose en el rigor científico y avances de los mismos, no por errores derivados de inconsistencias de su mismo sistema. Por este motivo, solicitamos tu apoyo para difundir este comunicado y nuestra voz sea escuchada.\nCarta a los Médios de Comunicación Por medio del presente comunicado, queremos hacer del conocimiento de la sociedad en su conjunto y a la comunidad científica mexicana los criterios empleados por la actual administración del Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT) para recortar el número de renovación de becas para estancias posdoctorales en el extranjero Vinculadas a la Consolidación de Grupos de Investigación y Fortalecimiento del Posgrado Nacional, año 2.\nDurante el año 2018 se asignaron 260 becas de primer año para proyectos postdoctorales en el extranjero. Este año se renovaron únicamente 88 proyectos para su continuidad. El criterio de peso no fue científico, ni se tomó en cuenta la pertinencia para el desarrollo del país ni las propuestas de colaboración internacional entre instituciones nacionales y extranjeras. Muchos aspirantes cuyas propuestas no fueron aceptadas fuimos notificados de que el motivo por el que fue descartada nuestra solicitud se debió a la falta de la identificación del investigador anfitrión.\nAlrededor de 30 de los afectados analizamos cómo era posible que un número tan elevado de investigadores hubiéramos cometido ese error. Al revisar toda la documentación se hizo evidente que fue consecuencia de una serie de omisiones e incosistencias en los lineamientos, guía y plataforma de captura por parte de los responsables de emitir la convocatoria. Con muy poco profesionalismo, se intentó subsanar todo esto con una nota al calce (en lugar de corregir la plataforma, o emitir un comunicado oficial). A pesar de que CONACyT acepta su error en la plataforma mantiene su dicho de culpar a los becarios de no enviar un documento entre tanta inconsistencia y confusión (documento que, por otra parte, se encuentra disponible en la plataforma como parte de los requisitos del primer año).\nAunado a esto y en busca de respuestas y casos similares (ya que los resultados no son de información pública). Se encontraron más investigadores cuyas solicitudes fueron desestimadas por razones tan absurdas como errores tipográficos u omisiones en el porcentaje de avance. Porcentajes que se perciben rápidamente al leer el informe detallado de avances (obligación del comité evaluador) y donde es claro que estos superan el porcentaje mínimo requerido por el Conacyt.\nEs importante mencionar que el CONACyT habilita su plataforma oficial para recopilar la información de cada aspirante y que dicha plataforma presenta fallas constantemente, las cuales entorpecen la integración de los requisitos demandados. Por ello los aspirantes intentamos seguir los lineamientos y guías previamente publicadas.\nEn conjunto, los afectados redactamos una carta dirigida a la Dra. María Elena Álvarez-Buylla Roces,al Dr. Mario Andrés De Leo Winkler y a la Lic. Irma Lucía Reyes Balleza, solicitando que se nos permitiera subsanar los errores de captura derivados de las inconsistencias en su plataforma y exhortando a los funcionarios del CONACyT que nuestras propuestas fueran evaluadas con base a su calidad, pertinencia, viabilidad del programa de trabajo, metas y productos finales correspondientes a la propuesta para el 2do año de estancia postdoctoral.\nEn respuesta, recibimos el oficio E2000/080/19 firmado por el Dr. Mario Andrés De Leo Winkler, en donde CONACyT acepta que modificó las condiciones y requisitos establecidos en la Convocatoria realizando cambios al aplicativo informático añadiendo una nota al calce en la ventana de documentos requeridos en una fecha posterior a la apertura de la convocatoria, sin embargo, en dicho oficio ratifican el dictamen previamente emitido que a la letra dice: “Su solicitud se encuentra incompleta, motivo por el cual no fue considerada dentro del proceso de asignación de becas establecidos en la Convocatoria y sus Términos de Referencia”.\nEl recorte presupuestal correspondiente a este y otros programas de becas en CONACyT pretende ser maquillado de manera insultante para nuestra trayectoria científica. Nos resulta decepcionante que los recursos invertidos por la nación durante el primer año se pierdan por detalles tan vanos. Esta decisión deja proyectos de alto impacto (justificables y comprobables) a medias, además de fracturar los convenios y lazos de colaboración establecidos con universidades y centros de investigación de gran prestigio a nivel mundial. En nuestra opinión, CONACyT ha violado su propia reglamentación interna (publicado en el Diario Oficial de la Federación del 16 de febrero del 2018) al impedir la presentación correcta de renovación para los proyectos de investigación. Todo pareciera apuntar a que se recurrió a prácticas engañosas de descalificación para no renovar los apoyos económicos a un gran número de investigaciones, consideradas relevantes en un principio.\nNo somos adversarios políticos, ni somos miembros activos de partidos con intereses ocultos. Somos investigadores mexicanos que pasamos los filtros más estrictos, con proyectos de gran calidad, para poder ser aceptados en la convocatoria de estancias posdoctorales en el extranjero año 1. Somos personas que buscamos el progreso de nuestro país a través de la ciencia. Nuestras investigaciones no son menores, entre el grupo de afectados nos encontramos investigadores que buscamos soluciones a graves enfermedades como el cáncer y la epilepsia; la solución a enfermedades comunes que afectan la salud pública. Se realizan investigaciones que buscan un mundo y un México más sostenible, como la evaluación y pertinencia del tren Maya como ruta cultural, por mencionar sólo algunas.\nPor todo lo anteriormente expuesto solicitamos la intervención del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador y al Secretario de Educación Pública Esteban Moctezuma Barragán, para una revisión, entre pares, minuciosa, objetiva y sin represalias de nuestro caso. Que se evalúen nuestras propuestas conforme a los criterios establecidos: cumplimiento de compromisos, relevancia y pertinencia para entender la realidad nacional.\nAnte una gran impotencia y decepción de la política en materia científica de la actual administración del gobierno federal, exponemos a ustedes nuestro caso solicitando su apoyo para su difusión con el objetivo de obtener una respuesta y resolución a la problemática que estamos viviendo cientos de investigadores mexicanos en diferentes partes del mundo. Esperamos que la exposición de nuestra situación ayude en un futuro corto a toda la comunidad científica que trabaja siempre por el progreso de nuestro país. Fuentes   Convocatoria 2018\n  Convocatoria 2019\n  Firmantes  Dr. Raúl Uziel Espinal Bustos (171768) Dra.
